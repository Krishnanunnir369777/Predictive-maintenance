# Predictive-maintenance
This is a  predictive maintenance AI/ML model using the Random Forest algorithm to forecast potential machine failures in windmill turbines. We designed a digital twin of a windmill turbine in MATLAB Simulink, which allowed us to gather high-fidelity data for training the machine learning model.
A key feature of our solution was the development of an intuitive UI/UX interface that enables users to input operational data, which the system uses to display real-time predictions made by the ML model. The interface is fully integrated with the windmill digital twin, allowing real-time adjustments based on predictions, improving both operational efficiency and reliability.
